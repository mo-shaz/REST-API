# ShellCorp-API
A basic RESTful CRUD API implemented using Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB

This is done as a part of my web developement journey while learning JavaScript and Node.js
This is my first proper project that does everything what I planned to do in the beginning

You can test this API out with any API testing tool (like POSTMAN) at https://shellcorp-api.herokuapp.com
The instructions are given on the landing page
